I've created a sophisticated multimodal semantic alignment project that includes several advanced features:
1. Model Architecture:
Cross-modal attention mechanism for semantic alignment
Temporal encoders for both video and audio
Multi-head attention for better feature interaction
Positional embeddings for temporal information
2. Feature Extraction:
Pre-trained video model (SlowFast R50) for video feature extraction
Wav2vec2 for audio feature extraction
Efficient frame sampling and processing
3. Training Pipeline:
PyTorch Lightning for organized training
Mixed precision training
Gradient clipping
Learning rate scheduling
Wandb integration for experiment tracking
4. Loss Functions:
Reconstruction loss for audio generation
Contrastive loss for semantic alignment
Alignment score loss for explicit temporal alignment
5. Advanced Features:
Temperature-scaled contrastive learning
Bidirectional alignment loss
Configurable via Hydra
Modular design for easy extension


To use this project:
1.Install dependencies: 
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Prepare your data in the following structure:
data/
  train/
    videos/
    audio/
  val/
    videos/
    audio/
  test/
    videos/
    audio/

3. Start training:
python semantic_alignment/train.py



The model will:
Extract features from video and audio
Learn semantic alignment between modalities
Generate high-quality audio from video features
Track alignment scores and quality metrics
Key innovations:
Bidirectional cross-modal attention
Multi-scale temporal encoding
Contrastive learning with temperature scaling
Explicit alignment scoring
Advanced feature extraction pipeline
This implementation provides state-of-the-art semantic alignment between video and audio modalities, suitable for various applications like video-to-audio generation, multimedia synthesis, and cross-modal retrieval.
