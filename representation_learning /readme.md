Here are some practical project modules you could build to practice representation learning for biological sequences:

1. **Sequence Data Preprocessor**
   - Build pipelines for cleaning and formatting protein/DNA/RNA sequences
   - Implement tokenization strategies (k-mer, amino acid, etc.)
   - Create data augmentation techniques specific to biological sequences

2. **Basic Embedding Model**
   - Implement a simple self-supervised model (LSTM or small transformer)
   - Train it to predict masked tokens in sequences
   - Visualize the learned embeddings using dimensionality reduction

3. **Embedding Evaluation Framework**
   - Develop metrics to assess embedding quality using functional annotations
   - Implement clustering analysis to see if similar proteins cluster together
   - Create visualization tools for embedding spaces

4. **Transfer Learning Module**
   - Fine-tune pre-trained models (like ESM-2) on specific protein families
   - Experiment with freezing different layers during transfer learning
   - Compare performance to training from scratch

5. **Multi-modal Integration Tool**
   - Combine sequence embeddings with structural features
   - Build models that can handle both sequence and structure inputs
   - Create functions to align different data modalities

6. **Downstream Task Predictor**
   - Build classifiers on top of your embeddings for functional prediction
   - Implement regression models for property prediction
   - Create visualization tools showing how embeddings relate to function

7. **Sequence Generation System**
   - Build a conditional generator that can create sequences with desired properties
   - Implement sampling strategies for diverse sequence generation
   - Create validation tools to assess generated sequence quality

8. **Interactive Exploration Tool**
   - Build a simple UI to explore the embedding space
   - Implement search functionality to find similar sequences
   - Create visualization tools showing evolutionary relationships

Would you like me to elaborate on any specific module?
