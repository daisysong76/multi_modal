Core Metrics:
Reconstruction Loss: Measures how well the model can reconstruct audio features from video features
Contrastive Loss: Evaluates the similarity between video and audio embeddings
Alignment Loss: Quantifies how well the video and audio modalities align temporally

The model outputs:
Predicted audio features
Alignment scores between video and audio
Embeddings for both modalities
Quality Assessment:
The model evaluates:
Audio-video temporal alignment
Feature reconstruction quality
Cross-modal similarity
Visualization:
You can visualize the results through:
Alignment scores over time
Embedding similarity plots
Reconstruction quality comparisons
Let me know if you'd like me to:
Add visualization code for better result interpretation
Implement additional evaluation metrics
