Absolutely! To deepen and future-proof your project, here are **5 of the most influential and relevant research papers** that explore multimodal fusion, emotion understanding, and instruction-tuned generative inferenceâ€”all of which align with your architecture and goals:

---

### ðŸ“Œ **1. [FLAVA: A Foundational Language And Vision Alignment Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.04482)**  
- **Authors:** Meta AI  
- **Why it's relevant:** Introduces a transformer architecture capable of **joint and aligned multimodal learning** from scratch (text + image + audio). It inspired much of today's multimodal fusion design.
- **Use in your project:** Adapt FLAVAâ€™s late fusion layers or training objective to combine HuBERT and BERT effectively.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **2. [Perceiver IO: A General Architecture for Structured Inputs & Outputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14795)**  
- **Authors:** DeepMind  
- **Why it's relevant:** Perceiver IO can handle **variable-length, high-dimensional multimodal input**â€”perfect for processing speech + text jointly.
- **Use in your project:** Replace your fusion transformer with a Perceiver IO to boost performance and scalability.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **3. [CM3leon: Open Language-Image Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07617)**  
- **Authors:** Meta AI  
- **Why it's relevant:** Introduces **multimodal masked modeling and instruction-tuned generation** using contrastive + generative objectives.
- **Use in your project:** Fine-tune your system on instruction templates (e.g., T5-based emotion explanation) using CM3leonâ€™s approach.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **4. [VATT: Learning Multimodal Representations from Video, Audio and Text](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.11178)**  
- **Authors:** Google Research  
- **Why it's relevant:** Learns robust representations across modalities (video/audio/text) using a **shared transformer backbone** and **contrastive pretraining**.
- **Use in your project:** VATTâ€™s encoder design and alignment training pipeline can enhance emotion inference or be extended to video inputs.

---

### ðŸ“Œ **5. [Supervised Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.11362)**  
- **Authors:** Google Brain  
- **Why it's relevant:** Reinforces the idea that **contrastive objectives outperform cross-entropy** for learning robust embeddingsâ€”especially for emotion datasets.
- **Use in your project:** Swap or augment your current loss with a supervised contrastive loss for fine-tuning on IEMOCAP/MELD.

Would you like me to:
- Add a `fusion_strategies.md` file summarizing how to implement these papers?
- Build a PerceiverIO or FLAVA-style fusion module for your script?
- Integrate supervised contrastive loss into your training loop?

Let me know where you want to take this nextâ€”paper-ready or product-ready ðŸš€

Your current architecture does a great job of integrating HuBERT and BERT with a simple transformer fusion, but if you're aiming for **state-of-the-art multimodal fusion**, there are more powerful alternatives.

## ðŸ”¬ Most Promising Fusion Techniques (for your task)

### âœ… **1. Perceiver IO** *(Best overall for multi-modal, variable-length input)*  
**Why:**  
- Designed to handle image, audio, and text efficiently.
- Uses **latent bottleneck attention** for scalability.
- Supports arbitrary input/output types (e.g., classification, generation, QA).

**How to Use in Your Project:**
- Replace your `FusionTransformer` with a [PerceiverIO encoder](https://github.com/deepmind/deepmind-research/tree/master/perceiver).
- Input: `text_embedding`, `audio_embedding` â†’ concatenate â†’ `PerceiverIO`.
- Output: fixed-length vector â†’ classifier head.

---

### âœ… **2. FLAVA-style Cross-Modal Transformer Fusion** *(Best for audio+text fusion)*  
**Why:**  
- FLAVA (Meta) uses **dual encoders + fusion transformer**, pretrained with contrastive and masked modeling.
- Robust for real-world emotion classification and retrieval.

**How to Use:**
- Keep `HuBERT` and `BERT` as encoders.
- Add a **cross-attention transformer** instead of averaging:
  ```python
  x = torch.cat([text_embeds.unsqueeze(1), audio_embeds.unsqueeze(1)], dim=1)
  fused = self.cross_modal_transformer(x)
  ```

---

### âœ… **3. FiLM (Feature-wise Linear Modulation)** *(Best for lightweight fusion)*  
**Why:**
- Popular in vision-language models.
- Use one modality (e.g., audio) to modulate the other (text) using learned affine transformations.

**How to Use:**
- Use audio embedding to conditionally transform text:
  ```python
  gamma = self.audio_to_gamma(audio_embedding)
  beta = self.audio_to_beta(audio_embedding)
  modulated = gamma * text_embedding + beta
  ```

---

### âœ… **4. Gated Multimodal Units (GMU)**  
**Why:**
- Learns modality importance dynamically.
- Especially useful for emotion tasks with ambiguous inputs.

**How to Use:**
```python
z = torch.sigmoid(Wz_text @ text_embeds + Wz_audio @ audio_embeds)
fused = z * text_embeds + (1 - z) * audio_embeds
```

## âœ¨ Recommendation for Your Project

For your current architecture, I recommend:
- **Replace** your `FusionTransformer` with **PerceiverIO** or a **cross-modal transformer** (FLAVA-style).
- Add **GMU** or **FiLM** as an optional lightweight fusion mode for ablation studies.

---

Would you like me to:
- Implement one of these (e.g., PerceiverIO or FLAVA fusion)?
- Compare two fusion strategies experimentally in your training loop?
- Or help create an ablation framework to benchmark fusion methods?
