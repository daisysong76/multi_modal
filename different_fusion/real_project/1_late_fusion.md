Looking at the code, this project primarily uses late fusion (decision-level fusion) in its multimodal processing approach. Let me explain the fusion strategies used:

1. **Late Fusion in Multimodal Processing**:
In the `process_multimodal` method of the `MultiModalProcessor` class, the system processes each modality separately and then combines them:

```python
def process_multimodal(self, item: DataItem) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # Process each modality independently
    results = {}
    if "text" in content_paths:
        results["text"] = self.process_text(text_item)
    if "image" in content_paths:
        results["image"] = self.process_image(image_item)
    if "audio" in content_paths:
        results["audio"] = self.process_audio(audio_item)
    if "video" in content_paths:
        results["video"] = self.process_video(video_item)
```

2. **Feature-Level Fusion**:
The system also implements a simple feature-level fusion when combining embeddings:

```python
# Combine embeddings if available
embeddings = []
for _, modality_item in modality_items.items():
    if hasattr(modality_item, "embedding") and modality_item.embedding is not None:
        embeddings.append(modality_item.embedding)

if embeddings:
    # Normalize embeddings before concatenation
    normalized_embeddings = []
    for emb in embeddings:
        norm = np.linalg.norm(emb)
        if norm > 0:
            normalized_embeddings.append(emb / norm)
        else:
            normalized_embeddings.append(emb)
    
    # Concatenate normalized embeddings
    item.embedding = np.concatenate(normalized_embeddings)
```

3. **Decision-Level Fusion**:
In the quality and bias assessment, the system uses decision-level fusion by:
- Processing each modality independently
- Computing individual scores
- Combining scores through averaging:

```python
# Calculate overall multimodal quality/bias score
overall_scores = []
for modality, scores in modality_scores.items():
    if "overall_score" in scores:
        overall_scores.append(scores["overall_score"])

metrics["overall_score"] = sum(overall_scores) / len(overall_scores)
```

The fusion strategy can be summarized as:
- Independent processing of each modality
- Feature-level fusion through normalized embedding concatenation
- Late fusion through score averaging for quality and bias metrics
- No early fusion (raw data level) is implemented

This approach allows for:
1. Modular processing of different modalities
2. Flexibility in handling missing modalities
3. Easy addition of new modalities
4. Independent scaling of modality-specific processing

The system could be enhanced by implementing:
- Early fusion techniques
- More sophisticated fusion strategies (e.g., attention mechanisms)
- Cross-modal learning
- Weighted fusion based on modality confidence
